# Magento 2 Delivery Time GraphQL

[Mageplaza Delivery Time for Magento 2](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-delivery-time-extension/) is an effective solution that makes delivery easier and flexible for customers. 

Customers can choose their preferred delivery dates through a smart calendar right next to the delivery date box. Your days off are also displayed in the fade mode and canâ€™t be picked up on the calendar so that customers can easily choose the perfect time for their orders to be shipped. From the admin backend, you can also set up a fixed time frame that customers can only choose from. In this way, you will have more control over the delivery times and therefore, serve customers better. 

Delivery Time for Magento 2 allows customers to leave messages on their orders so that they can communicate their specific preferences to the stores easily. Customers can note specific preferences about the location, delivery times, or anything else related to the orders to help shippers deliver the orders more easily.

Customers can choose their favorite delivery time right on the shipping method section, which is convenient for them. In this way, you can improve customer satisfaction on your website and reduce an incredible number of abandoned carts during the checkout.
